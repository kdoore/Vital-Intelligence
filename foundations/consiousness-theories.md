# Consiousness Theories

Definition

> ’Consciousness’ is a term often used as a synonym for self-awareness, or for social\
> coordination of internal states, but I’m using it in a limited, technical sense: a system has consciousness\
> if it feels like something to be that system. I.e., something is conscious if and only if it has subjective\
> experience. ’Qualia’ refers to the elements of consciousness, e.g., redness.
