### Four Domains of Vital Intelligence

The Vital Intelligence Model is structured around **four interdependent domains**—each a lens on how agents (human, machine, ecological) sense, relate, choose, and learn. Together they form the scaffolding for our Regenerative Cycle (see “Regenerative Cycle” page), ensuring that no domain evolves in isolation.

_Integrating Natural, Synthetic, and Vital (hybrid) capabilities across sensing, relating, choosing, and learning._

The Vital Intelligence Model weaves together:

* **NI** (Natural Intelligence): human‑embodied, somatic, contextual know‑how
* **AI** (Synthetic Intelligence): data‑driven scale, pattern‑recognition, algorithmic inference
* **VI** (Vital Intelligence): the emergent synergy of NI + AI, unlocking capabilities neither can achieve alone

### 1. ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)Embodied Interaction

**Essence:** Tuning sensory and somatic systems to perceive inner and outer worlds.

* **NI:** excels at nuanced interoception, emotional resonance, contextual awareness
* **AI:** limited—lacks a body, can’t feel or sense nuance; at best infers state from proxies (e.g., posture via vision models)
* **VI:** combines human grounding with AI‑augmented sensing (e.g., wearables + LLM feedback loops) to deepen embodiment

### 2. ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)Relational Mapping

**Essence:** Co‑constructing shared meaning via narratives, metaphors, networks.

* **NI:** brings cultural context, metaphorical insight, dialogic wisdom
* **AI:** excels at large‑scale graph analysis, pattern detection across texts/data, rapid prototyping of visual maps
* **VI:** merges human storytelling with AI’s data‑driven mappings to surface novel connections and emergent narratives

### 3. ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)Ethical Alignment

**Essence:** Surfacing shadow elements (bias, trauma, extractive patterns) and redirecting toward collective wellbeing.

* **NI:** contributes moral intuition, lived‑experience empathy, values‑driven judgment
* **AI:** can highlight statistical disparities, enforce rules at scale, but risks codifying bias if mis‑trained
* **VI:** leverages human ethics alongside AI’s audit trails and fairness‑monitoring to co‑design accountability loops

### 4. ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)Adaptive Learning

**Essence:** Evolving models over time through new data, insights, and emergent patterns.

* **NI:** brings hypothesis‑driven curiosity, reflective practice, tacit knowledge transfer
* **AI:** excels at rapid iteration, reinforcement learning, hyperparameter tuning across huge datasets
* **VI:** unites human sense‑making with AI’s scalable experimentation—anchored by human oversight and systemic coherence

### Interplay & Regeneration

These domains form a **feedback spiral** rather than a linear chain.

* **Embodied Interaction** grounds **Relational Mapping** in felt sense.
* **Relational Mapping** surfaces loops for **Ethical Alignment** to heal.
* **Ethical Alignment** steers **Adaptive Learning** toward just outcomes.
* **Adaptive Learning** feeds new insight back into **Embodied Interaction**.

Together, NI’s wisdom and AI’s scale co‑evolve as VI—powering a regenerative cycle where “shadow” becomes insight, and depletion becomes renewal. See **Regenerative Cycle – Integrating Shadow into Wisdom** for the detailed loop.
