### Alignment Matrix: Mapping NI, AI & VI to the Four Domains

This matrix shows at a glance how **Natural Intelligence (NI)**, **Synthetic Intelligence (AI)**, and their **hybrid synergy (VI = NI + AI)** each contribute to—and transform—our four domains of Vital Intelligence.

<table><thead><tr><th width="114.36328125">Domain</th><th width="201.8046875">NI: Human Strengths</th><th>AI: Synthetic Strengths</th><th>VI (NI + AI): Emergent </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Embodied Interaction</strong></td><td>Deep interoception, emotional nuance, context‑rich perception</td><td>Sensor data fusion, real‑time posture/biometric inference</td><td>Wearable‑LLM loops that guide somatic practice, blending felt sense with data insights</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Relational</strong> <br><strong>Mapping</strong></td><td>Cultural context, metaphorical insight, dialogic sense‑making</td><td>Large‑scale graph analytics, pattern mining across texts &#x26; media</td><td>Co‑created narratives that surface novel connections via human storytelling + AI mapping</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethical</strong> <br><strong>Alignment</strong><br></td><td>Moral intuition, lived‑experience empathy, values‑based judgment</td><td>Statistical fairness checks, rule‑based enforcement at scale</td><td>Accountability loops combining human ethics stewardship with AI audit trails</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Adaptive</strong> <br><strong>Learning</strong><br></td><td>Hypothesis‑driven curiosity, reflective feedback, tacit knowledge transfer</td><td>Rapid iteration (RL, hyperparameter tuning), big‑data simulation</td><td>Human‑anchored experimentation guided by AI’s scalability and swift scenario testing</td></tr></tbody></table>

> **Tip:** Use this matrix to design interventions, models, or system architectures that call on the precise strengths of humans, machines, and their collaborative synergy.
