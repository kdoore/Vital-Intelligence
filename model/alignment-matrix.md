# Alignment Matrix

### Alignment Matrix: Mapping NI, AI & VI to the Four Domains

This matrix shows at a glance how **Natural Intelligence (NI)**, **Synthetic Intelligence (AI)**, and their **hybrid synergy (VI = NI + AI)** each contribute to—and transform—our four domains of Vital Intelligence.

| Domain                   | NI: Human Strengths                                                        | AI: Synthetic Strengths                                          | VI (NI + AI): Emergent Hybrid Strengths                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Embodied Interaction** | Deep interoception, emotional nuance, context‑rich perception              | Sensor data fusion, real‑time posture/biometric inference        | Wearable‑LLM loops that guide somatic practice, blending felt sense with data insights   |
| **Relational Mapping**   | Cultural context, metaphorical insight, dialogic sense‑making              | Large‑scale graph analytics, pattern mining across texts & media | Co‑created narratives that surface novel connections via human storytelling + AI mapping |
| **Ethical Alignment**    | Moral intuition, lived‑experience empathy, values‑based judgment           | Statistical fairness checks, rule‑based enforcement at scale     | Accountability loops combining human ethics stewardship with AI audit trails             |
| **Adaptive Learning**    | Hypothesis‑driven curiosity, reflective feedback, tacit knowledge transfer | Rapid iteration (RL, hyperparameter tuning), big‑data simulation | Human‑anchored experimentation guided by AI’s scalability and swift scenario testing     |

> **Tip:** Use this matrix to design interventions, models, or system architectures that call on the precise strengths of humans, machines, and their collaborative synergy.
