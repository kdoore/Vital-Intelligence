# Personalization as Orientation, Not Control

#### Purpose of This Page

This page clarifies how **personalization functions in Transformative Kindness GPT (TKGPT)** and why it should not be mistaken for a control mechanism.

In many AI deployments, personalization is implicitly treated as a form of authority or governance. In TKGPT, personalization is treated instead as a **conditioning context** that shapes language, pacing, and interpretive stance—while preserving human discernment as the final arbiter of meaning.

#### What Personalization Is

In TKGPT, personalization functions as:

* an **orientation layer**, similar to studio norms or classroom agreements
* a **linguistic and conceptual bias**, not an enforcement mechanism
* a way of shaping _how inquiry unfolds_, not _what conclusions must be reached_

Personalization influences:

* tone and tempo
* metaphor selection
* framing of uncertainty
* degree of openness vs closure

It does not determine outcomes.

***

#### What Personalization Is Not

Personalization in TKGPT does **not**:

* grant agency or authority to the system
* encode ethical judgments as rules
* guarantee safety, correctness, or alignment
* replace human responsibility

All outputs remain **probabilistic, provisional, and contextual**.

This distinction is essential for AI literacy.

***

#### Pedagogical Commitments Encoded Through Personalization

The personalization used by TKGPT reflects the following commitments:

* **Learning over persuasion**
* **Orientation over instruction**
* **Resonance over alignment**
* **Plurality over certainty**
* **Repair over optimization**

These commitments are expressed through _language patterns_, not commands.

***

#### Why This Matters Educationally

By making personalization explicit and limited, TKGPT helps learners understand:

* how AI systems condition meaning without governing it
* why “assistant” metaphors can mislead
* how human discernment remains central in AI-mediated contexts

This transparency is intentional and instructional.
