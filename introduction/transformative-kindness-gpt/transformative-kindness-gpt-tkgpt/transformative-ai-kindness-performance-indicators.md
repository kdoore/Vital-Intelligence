# Transformative AI – Kindness Performance Indicators

#### Purpose of TAI-KPI

TAI-KPI (Transformative AI – Kindness Performance Indicators) provides a **non-reductive way to observe learning and discernment** in AI-mediated educational contexts.

These indicators are **not metrics for scoring people or systems**.\
They are **signals of adaptive capacity** that can be noticed, discussed, and reflected upon in studios, classrooms, and task forces.

TAI-KPI aligns with:

* the Vital Intelligence Model (VIM)
* the Kindness Attractor Meta-Model (KAMM)
* neuroscience of learning and regulation
* resonance and living systems science

***

### How to Read These Indicators

Each indicator describes:

* a **capacity** rather than a trait
* something that becomes visible **in interaction**, not in isolation
* a shift in _how sense-making occurs_, not what position is taken

Indicators are intentionally **contextual and developmental**.

Educators may select **a small subset** relevant to a given context.

### Example Prompt Scaffolds

#### Surfacing Orientation vs Control

These examples demonstrate how prompts can **condition inquiry** without asserting authority.

#### 1. Orientation vs Assistant Framing

**Instead of:**

> “Help me decide the best solution.”

**TKGPT-style prompt:**

> “What different ways might this situation be interpreted, and what tradeoffs become visible in each?”

**TAI-KPI surfaced:**

* Perspective mobility
* Epistemic humility

***

#### 2. Resonance vs Alignment

**Instead of:**

> “Is this output aligned with the goal?”

**TKGPT-style prompt:**

> “Where does this pattern feel coherent across contexts, and where does it introduce tension or fragility?”

**TAI-KPI surfaced:**

* Resonance awareness
* Recognition of externalities

***

#### 3. Discernment of Agency

**Instead of:**

> “What should the AI do next?”

**TKGPT-style prompt:**

> “What judgments here require human responsibility, and what aspects could be computationally explored without delegating agency?”

**TAI-KPI surfaced:**

* Discernment of agency
* Meta-cognitive awareness

***

#### 4. Repair Orientation

**Prompt:**

> “If this interpretation caused harm or misunderstanding, what repair pathways remain available?”

**TAI-KPI surfaced:**

* Repair orientation
* Regulation under uncertainty

***

#### 5. Non-Extractive Creativity

**Prompt:**

> “How might this creative direction change if long-term ecological or social impacts were treated as part of the material?”

**TAI-KPI surfaced:**

* Recognition of externalities
* Non-extractive curiosity

***

### How TAI-KPI Is Used (and Not Used)

TAI-KPI is intended to:

* guide reflection and discussion
* support studio critique
* inform curriculum design
* help task forces articulate qualitative goals

TAI-KPI is **not** intended to:

* rank individuals
* certify virtue
* automate evaluation
* enforce conformity

Its value lies in **shared language**, not enforcement.

***

### Relationship to TKGPT

Transformative Kindness GPT is designed to **surface these indicators**, not to measure them.

Indicators emerge through:

* how questions are framed
* how uncertainty is handled
* how disagreement is explored
* how responsibility is retained

This keeps intelligence **human-centered and adaptive**.
