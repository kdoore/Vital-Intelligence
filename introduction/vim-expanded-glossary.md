# VIM Expanded Glossary

### A Shared Language for Vital Intelligence (VIM)

#### Purpose of This Glossary

This glossary establishes a **shared, interdisciplinary vocabulary** for discussing intelligence, learning, AI, and institutional change in a generative-AI era.

Many conflicts around AI, education, and governance are not disagreements about goals, but **misalignments in mental models**. Words such as _intelligence_, _control_, _ethics_, or _learning_ are often used as if they were universal—when in fact they carry deeply different assumptions across domains.

This glossary is designed to:

* reduce semantic drift
* surface hidden assumptions
* support discernment rather than judgment
* evolve as the VIM framework evolves

It is intentionally **descriptive rather than prescriptive**.

***

### Core VIM Concepts

#### **Vital Intelligence (VIM)**

A meta-model of intelligence defined as the **capacity of systems to sustain learning, dignity, and viability under conditions of uncertainty and change**.

VIM integrates Natural Intelligence (NI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Collective Intelligence (CI) as inseparable and co-evolving.

***

#### **Natural Intelligence (NI)**

Human intelligence understood as **embodied, emotional, relational, and shaped by experience**.

NI includes:

* subconscious and pre-verbal models
* affective and somatic signals
* trauma- and stress-sensitive cognition

NI is not optimized for speed or certainty; it evolved for survival, meaning-making, and social coordination.

***

#### **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

Statistical, probabilistic systems trained on historical data to generate predictions, patterns, or content.

Key characteristics:

* non-authoritative
* non-intentional
* sensitive to context and framing
* prone to hallucination and bias

Within VIM, AI is treated as an **exploratory partner**, not a source of truth.

***

#### **Collective Intelligence (CI)**

The capacity of groups, organizations, and cultures to **sense, learn, coordinate, and adapt together**.

CI depends on:

* trust and psychological safety
* communication quality
* feedback and repair mechanisms

CI cannot be enforced through hierarchy alone; it must be **cultivated through conditions**.

***

### Learning & Cognition

#### **Simulationist Learning**

A learning mode in which understanding emerges through **modeling, experimentation, iteration, and reflection**, rather than memorization or rule execution.

Simulationist learners:

* test hypotheses
* observe system behavior
* revise mental models over time

This framing aligns with studio pedagogy, systems engineering, and learning sciences.

***

#### **Mental Model**

An internal representation of how a system works, often implicit and subconscious.

Mental models:

* guide perception and action
* are resistant to change under stress
* update through experience, not instruction alone

VIM emphasizes making mental models **explicit, shared, and revisable**.

***

#### **Discernment**

Context-aware judgment guided by relational signals and system dynamics.

Discernment differs from judgment:

* judgment is static and binary
* discernment is adaptive and situational

Discernment is a core skill for working with AI under uncertainty.

***

#### **Pause**

A deliberate interruption in action or interaction that allows **regulation, reflection, and re-orientation**.

In VIM, pause is a **design choice**, not disengagement—especially critical in addictive, high-velocity media environments.

***

### Systems & Modeling

#### **Control-Flow Mental Model**

A worldview in which systems are understood as deterministic, hierarchical, and governed by explicit rules.

Effective in stable, closed systems.\
Misleading for generative AI and complex social systems.

***

#### **Simulation / Modeling**

The practice of representing systems to explore behavior under varying conditions.

In VIM:

* models are provisional
* error is informative
* multiple representations are encouraged

Modeling becomes a **shared language** across disciplines.

***

#### **Attractor**

A stable pattern or region in a system’s state space toward which behavior tends to converge.

In social-technical systems, attractors can be:

* fear-based (compliance, silencing)
* care-based (trust, learning)

Kindness functions as a **learning-stabilizing attractor**.

***

#### **Emergence**

System-level behavior that arises from interactions among components rather than from centralized control.

CI and intelligence itself are emergent phenomena.

***

### Ethics, Kindness, and Wellbeing

#### **Kindness (Technical Definition)**

A neuro-social stabilizing condition that:

* reduces threat responses
* supports trust and cooperation
* enables learning under uncertainty

Kindness in VIM is **functional**, not sentimental.

***

#### **Ethics-as-Capacity**

Ethics understood not as rules or checklists, but as the **human capacity to navigate complex situations with care, accountability, and discernment**.

This capacity degrades under chronic stress and threat.

***

#### **Trauma-Informed**

An approach recognizing that stress, harm, and unresolved threat shape cognition, behavior, and learning.

Trauma-informed design emphasizes:

* safety
* choice
* agency
* repair

***

### Economics, Institutions, and Power

#### **Wellbeing Economy**

An economic framing that prioritizes **long-term human and planetary viability** over short-term extraction or growth.

Often contrasted with optimization-driven models.

***

#### **Dominance Hierarchy**

An organizational structure emphasizing control, ranking, and compliance.

Dominance hierarchies tend to:

* suppress CI
* incentivize fear-based behavior
* stall learning under uncertainty

***

#### **Nested / Relational Hierarchy**

A structure in which authority and responsibility are **distributed and context-sensitive**, allowing feedback to flow upward and laterally.

Supports CI and adaptability.

***

#### **VUCA**

Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity — the prevailing operating conditions for modern institutions.

VIM is explicitly designed for VUCA contexts.

***

### Media, Information, and AI

#### **Information as Terrain**

A framing in which information is understood as something navigated, not consumed.

Learners develop orientation skills rather than seeking certainty.

***

#### **Slopaganda**

Low-quality, emotionally manipulative AI-generated content optimized for attention rather than meaning.

Creates cognitive noise and undermines discernment.

***

#### **AI Psychosis**

A colloquial term describing disorientation, over-trust, or delusional meaning-making arising from prolonged interaction with generative systems without grounding or regulation.

***

### Pedagogy & Practice

#### **Synectics**

A creative method using metaphor and analogy to surface hidden assumptions and support integrative thinking.

In VIM, synectics functions as a **metacognitive scaffold**.

***

#### **MPCM (Materials–Process–Context–Meaning)**

A studio-based framework for structuring learning and reflection.

MPCM aligns naturally with simulationist and experiential pedagogy.

***

#### **Studio Pedagogy**

A learning approach emphasizing:

* making and iteration
* critique and reflection
* situated learning

Studio pedagogy supports NI, AI literacy, and CI simultaneously.

***

### Extending This Glossary

This glossary is intentionally **open-ended**.

Future expansions may include:

* discipline-specific terms (engineering, CS, arts)
* modeling formalisms
* governance and policy language
* student-facing versions

Contributions should prioritize:

* clarity over cleverness
* precision over persuasion
* shared understanding over authority
