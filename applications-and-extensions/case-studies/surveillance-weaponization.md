# Surveillance Weaponization

**Context:**\
ShadowDragon’s SocialNet quietly harvests public data from 200+ sites—Instagram, Duolingo, LinkedIn, Tinder, Etsy, etc.—to build invasive profiles sold to law-enforcement and government agencies. This campaign by Mozilla Fellow Esra’a Al Shafei mobilizes major platforms to block such scraping \[2]

***

### 1. Background

* **What is SocialNet?**\
  An OSINT tool pulling publicly-available data across hundreds of services to map people’s networks, movements, and attributes \[1].
* **Who uses it?**\
  ICE, FBI, DEA, Australian Signals Directorate, state/local police.
* **Why it matters:**\
  No single site “gives it all away,” but combined data yields deeply invasive insights.

### 3. Implications for Vital Intelligence

1. **Decentralized Protocols:** Promote federated data-sharing standards that preserve agency.
2. **Behavioral Mandates:** Require platforms to opt-in data access—no “hidden” scraping.
3. **Collective Oversight:** Build cross-jurisdictional coalitions (Mozilla, EPIC, civil society) to audit surveillance technologies.
4. **Restoring Trust:** Embed “right to disconnect” and data-erasure guarantees into platform design.
