# The Art of Kindness



{% embed url="https://neuroscienceofkindness.gitbook.io/main" %}

COVID-19 has shaken things up and brought many unforeseen challenges in 2021. Now more than ever, it is imperative to address kindness as a key potentiator of brain health. We are hosting an art contest bringing the neuroscience of kindness and the conceptual framework of art synectics together to create an outlet for students to share their experiences during COVID-19.
