# Platform Monopolies

**Context:**\
Two landmark U.S. rulings in 2024–25 found Google illegally maintaining monopolies in both search and digital advertising. These decisions offer a powerful lens on how platform power can distort information flows and reinforce self-serving feedback loops \[1].

***

### 1. Background

* **Search Monopoly (Aug 2024):** Google paid billions to be the default engine on browsers and devices, securing \~90% market share.
* **Ad-tech Monopoly (Apr 2025):** Google structured its ad auctions to privilege its own exchange, capturing an average of >30% of ad spend \[2].

### 3. Implications for Vital Intelligence

1. **Structural Remedies:** Divestiture and enforced interoperability break feedback loops that lock in dominance.
2. **Behavioral Rules:** Transparency in AI-model training and ad auctions fosters trust and collective monitoring.
3. **Global Coordination:** Aligned antitrust actions across jurisdictions prevent regulatory arbitrage.
4. **Power & Knowledge:** Democratising infrastructure shifts rule-setting power back toward communities.
