# Annotated Bibliography

_Organized by Bridge Checklist panel · 49 sources · TAI-KPI Framework_

***

This bibliography represents the core research foundation of the TAI-KPI framework and the Bridge Checklist. Sources are organized by their primary relevance to each panel, reflecting the interdisciplinary synthesis that distinguishes this approach from conventional AI literacy frameworks.

Each annotation is written for an educated non-specialist reader. For deeper theoretical context, see Theoretical Foundations.

### A note on this bibliography

These 50 sources were selected for their relevance across the interdisciplinary synthesis that the TAI-KPI framework represents. They span neuroscience, evolutionary biology, resilience and complexity science, information theory, educational equity, AI governance, and consciousness research — fields that are rarely brought into conversation with each other in AI literacy contexts.

The selection prioritizes publicly available sources where possible. For sources that require institutional access, the annotations are written to communicate the key contribution without requiring the reader to access the full text.

This bibliography will be updated as the framework is tested in educational and organizational contexts and as the research landscape develops.

For the full theoretical discussion of how these sources connect to the Bridge Checklist panels, see Theoretical Foundations.
