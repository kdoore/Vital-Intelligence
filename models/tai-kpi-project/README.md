### TAI-KPI:   AI Literacy Framework

Transformative AI – Kindness & Prosocial Integration (TAI-KPI) is an AI-literacy framework that treats humans, organizations, and AI systems as **interacting information flows** rather than isolated objects.

The core idea is simple:

> Our wellbeing and our governance depend on how clearly\
> information can move _within_ us, _between_ us, and _through_ the AI systems we build.

As AI becomes more autonomous and “agentic,” it no longer functions as a passive tool at the edges of human decision-making. It becomes a **participant in our information ecology**—shaping what we see, how we coordinate, and which futures feel possible.

TAI-KPI proposes that if we want trustworthy, sustainable AI integration, we need:

* **Models of information flow between agents** (human ↔ human, human ↔ AI, AI ↔ AI).
* **Organizational structures that support bidirectional feedback**, not just top-down control.
* **AI-literate humans** who can see their own nervous systems, their institutions, and their tools as parts of a larger, living system.
