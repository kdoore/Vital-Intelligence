# Teaching Stack of Models for TAI-KPI

### 1. Why a “Teaching Stack” of Models?

TAI-KPI isn’t just a curriculum about AI.\
It’s a **language of models** that helps humans understand:

* how our own cognition and emotions work,
* how socio-technical systems amplify or ease stress,
* how AI systems mirror and reshape our world-models, and
* how trust can grow from the bottom up in a fractured, post-colonial world.

No single diagram can carry all of that.\
Instead, we use a **stack of simple, interlocking models**—each one a different lens:

* _Automata of cognition_
* _Expectation–Mismatch Stress (EMS) & Window of Tolerance_
* _Bayesian Brain & Weather Forecasting_
* _Markov Blankets & Boundaries_
* _Cellular Automata & Social Emergence_
* _Trust Dynamics in System-Dynamics form_
* _Holarchy & Reverse Mentoring_
* _AI as a Theory-of-Mind Mirror_

Together, these give students, AI developers, and community organizers a **shared vocabulary** that can travel across disciplines, cultures, and power gradients.

> _The teaching stack is our “minimum viable language” for describing how intelligence, trust, and power flow in a VUCA world._

### 2. Model 1 – Automata of Cognition

#### Reflex • Pattern • Integrative Layers

**Purpose**\
Give learners a compact, non-pathologizing map of human cognition that foregrounds emotion and embodiment.

**Key Ideas**

* **Reflex Automaton** – fast somatic responses, polyvagal survival modes, “snake or stick?” decisions.
* **Pattern Automaton** – emotional & associative flow; habits; narrative templates; subconscious priors.
* **Integrative Layer** – awareness, meaning, attention aperture; active inference; self-observation; wisdom.

**Teaching Moves**

* Use lived examples: a startle response, a conflict, a moment of regret.
* Ask: _“Which layer was driving?”_ and _“What other layer might you want online next time?”_
* Emphasize that **all three layers are intelligent**; the Integrative Layer coordinates them.

**Curricular Role**

* This is the **anchor model**.
* Other metaphors (EMS, weather, Markov blankets, trust dynamics) all plug back into it.

***

### 3. Model 2 – EMS & the Window of Tolerance

#### Expectation–Mismatch Stress as Cognitive Load

**Purpose**\
Reframe “trauma” as **Expectation–Mismatch Stress (EMS)** and introduce the **Window of Tolerance / attention aperture** as a flexible, trainable capacity.

**Key Ideas**

* EMS = cumulative strain when expectations repeatedly fail to match reality.
* Shows up as anxiety, numbness, irritability, distraction, or collapse.
* **Window of Tolerance** = the range in which the Integrative Layer can stay online and keep all three automata in dialogue.
* Contemplative, somatic, and relational practices **widen** this window over time.

**Teaching Moves**

* Invite students to sketch their own Window of Tolerance and label “too much / too little” activation.
* Link back to the automata:
  * Narrow window → Reflex dominates, Pattern rigidifies, Integrative goes offline.
  * Wider window → Integrative can re-interpret signals and reweight emotional priors.

**Curricular Role**

* Bridges personal experience (stress, burnout, anxiety) with systemic forces (VUCA, climate crisis, AI disruption).
* Sets the tone for a **trauma-informed, non-blaming** conversation.

***

### 4. Model 3 – Bayesian Brain & Weather Forecasting

#### “Your Mind as a Climate Model”

**Purpose**\
Explain active inference in plain language: we are all **forecasting machines**.

**Key Ideas**

* The nervous system constantly predicts what will happen next and updates its “climate model” of life.
* **Forecast** = prior expectations.
* **Weather event** = incoming experience.
* **Prediction error** = mismatch between forecast and reality.
* Chronic EMS is like living in **permanent storm mode**, even on clear days.

**Teaching Moves**

* Ask: _“What forecasts did you learn growing up? About safety, authority, conflict, success?”_
* Explore how new experiences and communities help **update the climate model**.
* Connect to Integrative Layer: it’s the “climate scientist” that can question old forecasts and design new ones.

**Curricular Role**

* Makes Active Inference intuitive.
* Prepares the ground for talking about **AI as another kind of forecasting system**—but without a body or emotions.

***

### 5. Model 4 – Markov Blankets & Boundaries

#### Where Self Meets World

**Purpose**\
Offer a visual language for **boundaries**—psychological, social, and institutional—without heavy math.

**Key Ideas**

* A **Markov blanket** is a conceptual boundary between “inside” and “outside” of a system.
* For humans: body, identity, role, and community all act as layered blankets.
* For institutions: policies, dashboards, and AI systems act as blankets between leadership and lived reality.
* Healthy blankets allow **porous, meaningful exchange**; unhealthy ones either leak or harden.

**Teaching Moves**

* Have learners draw their own “layers”: body, family, peers, institution, platform, planet.
* Ask: _“Where does information flow freely? Where does it get blocked or distorted?”_
* Connect to EMS: rigid blankets trap old priors; open, well-governed blankets allow updating and repair.

**Curricular Role**

* Prepares students to think about **AI governance and interfaces** as boundary design problems.
* Integrates holarchy: individuals and institutions as nested blankets.

***

### 6. Model 5 – Cellular Automata & Social Emergence

#### Micro-Rules, Macro-Patterns

**Purpose**\
Show how local interaction rules create large-scale social patterns, making the **Avalanche of Kindness** plausible rather than utopian.

**Key Ideas**

* Each person is a small automaton (Reflex–Pattern–Integrative).
* Simple rules (listen, retaliate, forgive, share, exclude) generate complex group behavior.
* Trust, polarization, cooperation, and collapse **emerge** from these micro-rules.
* Changing the rules ≈ changing the future trajectory of society.

**Teaching Moves**

* Run or show simple cellular automata (e.g., Conway’s Game of Life) or agent-based demos.
* Ask: _“What micro-rules around you are feeding conflict or extraction?”_
* Then: _“What micro-rules could feed prosocial cascades?”_

**Curricular Role**

* Makes it thinkable that **college meetups and developer communities matter**: changing local rules really does influence global patterns, especially in a networked world.
* Connects naturally to **Kindness Thermodynamics** and trust dynamics.

***

### 7. Model 6 – Trust Dynamics as a System-Dynamics Loop

#### Trust as a Stock, EMS as a Load

**Purpose**\
Give a simple system-dynamics picture of how **trust** accumulates and depletes over time, so learners see why process and governance matter as much as insight.

**Key Ideas**

* **Trust** = a stock that can rise (through repair, reliability, shared risk) or fall (through betrayal, opacity, neglect).
* **Flows** that increase trust: transparency, follow-through, fair conflict resolution, shared vulnerability, inclusive design.
* **Flows** that decrease trust: secrecy, extractive AI deployments, broken promises, unresolved harms, colonial patterns.
* EMS acts as **friction** in the system:
  * higher EMS → slower trust accumulation, faster trust decay.
* Prosocial emergence requires **trust thresholds**: enough trust in enough nodes for new patterns to be stable.

**Teaching Moves**

* Draw a simple stock-and-flow diagram: Trust Reservoir with “Trust Inflow” and “Trust Outflow”.
* Invite participants to list real behaviors or policies that belong on each valve.
* Connect to Integrative Layer: leaders and teams can deliberately design **trust-building loops** instead of assuming trust will appear by itself.

**Curricular Role**

* Links internal work (widening the Window of Tolerance) with structural work (changing rules, policies, AI use).
* Makes it easier to talk about **bottom-up transformation**: student & developer meetups are “trust pumps” connecting layers of the holarchy.

***

### 8. Model 7 – Holarchy & Reverse Mentoring

#### Bottom-Up Intelligence in Nested Systems

**Purpose**\
Show how knowledge, care, and imagination can flow **upward** through a hierarchy without collapsing into rebellion or co-optation.

**Key Ideas**

* Holarchy = nested wholes (individuals → teams → orgs → regions → planet).
* Each level has local intelligence and constraints.
* **Reverse mentoring** = structured pathways for insights from younger / less powerful nodes to influence decision-makers.
* When combined with the shared modeling language, reverse mentoring becomes **a translation channel**:
  * students and developers bring VIM / EMS / automata language upward,
  * leaders learn to reinterpret their own prediction models through these lenses.

**Teaching Moves**

* Map participants’ own institutions as holarchies.
* Identify possible reverse-mentoring channels: advisory councils, intergenerational task forces, student–faculty–admin circles, community–developer–policymaker forums.
* Emphasize **post-colonial ethos**:
  * the point is not “saving” others, but **listening and integrating diverse world-models**.

**Curricular Role**

* Explains _how_ TAI-KPI ideas can move from classrooms and meetups into leadership and policy.
* Frames prosocial AI work as **intergenerational and intercultural co-learning**, not top-down tech transfer.

***

### 9. Model 8 – AI as a Theory-of-Mind Mirror

#### Practicing Metacognition With Machines

**Purpose**\
Use AI tools themselves as **practice grounds** for theory of mind, critical thinking, and emotional literacy.

**Key Ideas**

* AI systems don’t feel, but they can simulate perspectives and highlight patterns in our own thinking.
* Interacting with AI can help learners:
  * see their own assumptions mirrored back,
  * explore multiple framings of the same situation,
  * practice asking “what else might be going on here?”
* In a trauma-informed context, AI is **not a therapist**; it is a **structured reflection partner**.

**Teaching Moves**

* Design prompts that ask AI to:
  * generate alternative stories about a conflict,
  * outline different stakeholders’ viewpoints,
  * suggest questions a wise mentor might ask.
* Always debrief:
  * Where did the AI miss important context?
  * What biases did it reveal?
  * What did _you_ notice in your own emotional response?

**Curricular Role**

* Ties together the whole teaching stack:
  * automata of cognition,
  * EMS & Window of Tolerance,
  * weather/forecasting,
  * Markov blankets,
  * social emergence,
  * trust dynamics,
  * holarchy,\
    into a **living practice** with real tools.

> _TAI-KPI does not ask students to believe a new ideology._\
> &#xNAN;_&#x49;t gives them a shared set of models to see how human, organizational, and AI systems actually behave—and to design prosocial, trauma-informed alternatives from the bottom up._
