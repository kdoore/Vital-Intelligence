### Contemplative Arts Practices and Trauma-Informed Practices and Resources



### Humanity++:   Paradigm Shifting - Emergence - Collective Energy Resonance Patterns&#x20;

Cellular automata, GPU type simulations are the New Kind of Science as shown by Steven Wolfram's Research and Wolfram Math applications.  Environments and agents co-adapt as interdependent ecosystems.

In reality, we are interdependent with our environments, so as the environment changes, we can learn to embrace changing as a natural process associated within our nested ecosystems of relational changes happening across the cosmos, globe, community, and within our organism composed of a universe of smaller organisms that defy the laws of entropy...through resonance vibrational patterns associated with neg-entropy in living systems. These skills are a developmental process because the human body is a dynamic process based complex adaptive system that has an intrinsic capacity for resilience and adapting to environmental changes.  \
\
This ripples out from individual, collective and environmental wellbeing to form a holistic life-long learning approach.&#x20;

[OECD Teaching Compass](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-teaching-compass_8297a24a-en.html]) - Lifelong Learning in the context of exponential changes requires developing nervous-system self-regulation skills.  \

> &#x20;"Individual wellbeing emphasizes personal growth, resilience and the competencies needed for navigating a rapidly evolving and uncertain world".  Education, in this context, fosters personal fullfillment, equipping learners to manage challanges proactively.  Collective wellbeing expands the scope beyond the individual, stressing the importance of social cohesion, inclusion, and collaborative efforts within communities" It promotes shared goals, mutual respect, and collective responsibility.  Environmental well-being broadens the lens further, underscoring sustainability, environmental stewardship, and responsible resource management to ensure a thriving future for subsequent generations" \
