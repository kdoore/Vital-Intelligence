### Language and Graphical Model Schemas As Human Operating Systems: &#x20;

Intelligence is a complex dynamic process that follows a lifelong developmental trajectory for humans.  Language development is a unique human skill that has allowed Humanity to collaborate and adapt to changing environments and ecosystems.  &#x20;

GDP and Accelerationism as patterns of narrative-ideology with GOALS of Profit for the few, while exploiting resources of the commons.   \
\
This is not humane intelligence, these are extractive algorithms.\
&#x20; \
Technologies Focused on A Goal of Profits through Hyper-Narratives

> LLM's have harnessed human language for profit using algorithms that optimize engagement of attention.  The negative impacts on human wellbeing and literacy are extremely concerning.  These systems are negatively impacting human cognitive developmental processes of intelligence\
> \
> LLM and web media can operate at subliminal levels to engage emotional reward patterns.  This attentional engagement can be addictive, seductive, and psychologically destabilizing as for humans with deep impacts on social, emotional, regulation.

Information Visualization Hierarchy: Data, information, knowledge, understanding, wisdom.  Sub-symbolic models, visual schemas, text-based symbolic reasoning,

Human experiences and relationships have healthy friction because negative feedback is stabilizing and helps individuals expand world models to learn resilience and adaptation for complex systems, while positive feedback is destabilizing. &#x20;

Legacy intergenerational trauma and early experiences of childhood trauma of violence, abuse, accidents, illness in 30-40% of the population (ACE), show that learning techniques for nervous system self-regulation, meditation, coping skills can help individuals develop resilience and co-regulation skills.&#x20;

COVID was a global trauma, it was an opportunity for humans to understand the interdependencies of systems and the fragilities of human organizational systems to adaptively manage the spread of the virus including the spread of misinformation across social-media technologies that spread conspiracy theories that interfered with a coordinated public health response.
