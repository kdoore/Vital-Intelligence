### See the Big Picture:  Expanding the Doughnut World Model -> Toroidal Resonance

**Expanding the Doughnut -> Doughnut Economics Action Lab: Global Community of Practice**\
\
Systems-Thinking: Earth Materials and Virtual  Engineering, Sciences of Complexity and Resonances, and Contemplative Arts Practices: **Complexity of self-adaptive intelligent systems**\
\
**Attention:** Guides Human Consciousness Metaphysics and Intelligence - Expectations and Uncertainty in the midst of exponential technological changes.\
\
**Triggering an Avalanche of Kindness  - Humanity++ - Radical Kindness, Choice, Agency**

> _**Attention is the doorway; narrative is the home we build inside it.**_ \
> \
> _Without metacognitive discernment —especially under stress — our stories harden into self-delusion. That’s why extractive attention markets are developmentally dangerous, particularly for children and our collective consciousness - our inner-children_\
> \
> _Our work is grounded through teaching **attention literacy** and designing technologies that serve to guide adaptive processes that attune humane systems for planetary wellbeing_

Exponentially changing technologies,  trauma‑aware neuroscience,  toroidal resonance models of biophysical systems, AI‑assisted world‑modeling → a new virtual–material ecosystem that must be adaptively steered toward nurturing safe‑and‑just spaces for living systems.
