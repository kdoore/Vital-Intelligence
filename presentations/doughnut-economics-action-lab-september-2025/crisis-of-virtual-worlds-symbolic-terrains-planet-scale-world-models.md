#### Overview:  Frontier Scaling of AI Models: Existential Threats,  Hyper-narratives, Race Conditions to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Artificial Super Intelligence &#x20;

This dystopian reality reflects behaviors of global leaders who exploit public commons, create hyper-narratives focused on projection of black-box AI for military dominance ,surveillance, amplify business profits through deregulation, denial, obscuration of data associated with climate-crisis. Bad-faith actors use media for propaganda, entertainment,  corruption, projections of populism, and illusions of control.  Move fast and break things, shows that the systems are broken and now is the opportunity to transition to systems aligned with global civic commons, social justice,  environmental sustainability, and stewardship.

**LLM’s:** the most powerful general‑purpose pattern instrument built by humans?  What problems can it solve?  Can we trigger a transition to global governance models using **neuro-symbolic** to guide trustworthy human collaboration using HCI design for information augmentation systems?  \
\
The engineering design of LLM's goal is profit through marketing cycles of consumer engagement, addiction, distraction, narrow information bubbles that align with conspiracy narratives to destabilize democratic governance models —akin to public infrastructure converted to a living library of garbage / noise.\
&#x20;\
Our choices: amplify belonging and relational truth—or spectacle and illusions of control.  \
\
LLMs as socio‑technical mirrors—they reflect and recombine collective world models
