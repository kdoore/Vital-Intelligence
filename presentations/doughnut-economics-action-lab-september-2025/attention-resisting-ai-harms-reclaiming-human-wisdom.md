### Expanding the Doughnut World Model -> Attention for Global Wellbeing

**Expanding the Doughnut ->**[ **Doughnut Economics Action Lab:**](http://www.doughnuteconomics.org/) **Global Community of Practice**\
\
Systems-Thinking: Earth Materials and Virtual  Engineering, Sciences of Complexity and Resonances, and Contemplative Arts Practices: **Complexity of self-adaptive intelligent systems**\
\
**Attention:** Guides Human Consciousness: Metaphysics and Intelligence - Expectations and Uncertainty in the midst of exponential technological changes.\
\
**Triggering an Avalanche of Kindness  - Humanity++ - Radical Kindness, Choice, Agency**

> _**Attention is the doorway; narrative is the home we build inside it.**_ \
> \
> _Without metacognitive discernment —especially under stress — our stories can harden into self-delusion.  Extractive attention markets are developmentally dangerous, particularly for children and our collective consciousness - our inner-children_\
> \
> _This work is grounded through teaching **attention literacy** and designing technologies that serve to guide adaptive processes that attune humane systems for planetary wellbeing_

Exponentially changing technologies,  trauma‑aware neuroscience,  toroidal resonance models of biophysical systems, AI‑assisted world‑modeling → a new virtual–material ecosystem that can be adaptively steered toward nurturing safe‑and‑just spaces for living systems.

_watercolor and ink painting of a toroidal energy form seen three-quarters view, nested spirals and ribbon-like currents orbiting and weaving through the ring, subtle interference rings like standing waves, indigo and teal washes with sepia hatching, delicate starlike nodes hinting at parametric structure, vintage atlas paper texture, the 2D doughnut blossoming into a multi-dimensional geometry_
