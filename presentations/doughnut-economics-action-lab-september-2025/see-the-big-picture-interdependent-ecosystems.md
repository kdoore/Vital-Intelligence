## Ecosystems View:  Interdependent Systems of Information Flows

The virtual world introduces a new ecosystem to the global ecosystems, this represents a paradigm shift in technology that has transitioned from static control-flow systems for logic processing to a distributed system where decision-making and information processing are moving to edge-based paradigm where processing can use local contexts and reduce latency.  In human systems, this means that humans with laptops, tablets, cell-phones must learn literacy for wise decision-making agency and accountability.  \


This fundamental paradigm shift is at odds with AI models that employ black-box processes.\

\
The virtual world has material, embodied impacts in terms of trust, energy, water, waste....\
\
Neuroscience advances using AI systems have helped highlight the structure of \
\
The complexity of this expanded world model increases difficulty of decision-making for human systems.\
