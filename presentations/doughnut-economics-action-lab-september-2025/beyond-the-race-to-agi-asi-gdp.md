Be Agnostic about Growth ( Thriving > Racing )

Living systems cycle through periods of birth, growth, decay and death.  Learning to feel these energies as part of normal cycles of emotional oscillations associated with living in complex social-cultural ecosystems.  How to find equanimity in the midst of an information torrent.  Wisdom is learning to regulate nervous system to minimize wasted energy.  Learn to find a pathway of balance in lifelong learning….. self-being, becoming, belonging..\
\
Speed is a scalar…recognize the signals of toxic media. Personal momentum is a vector…it requires learning habits of pausing to notice silence in order to find personal dignity and resonance: \
\
human insight is embodied simulation, feelings are associated with feeling gravity and forces, emotional roller coaster rides…\
\
If we choose adventure, we learn to dance through rigid expectations. We dissolve our egocentric bubbles and we seek out critical feedback, then we learn resilience. \
\
Friction, challange, failures are necessary for intelligent adaptive systems to drive neuroplacticity…you can learn to expand your world models by being vulnerable, seeking divergent interactions, moving beyond expectations and then nurturing confusing emotions…\
\
Learn to recognize the consequences that your decision-making has on others

Is your repressed trauma expressed as relational drama?…Perfection is not the goal.  \
Kindness  - inner- compass - nervous-system regulation.  Find grace and style in the journey to nurture collaborative wisdom.
