# Established Learning Frameworks and Their Domains

The following frameworks are commonly referenced—explicitly or implicitly—in higher education leadership, accreditation, and pedagogy discussions:

<table><thead><tr><th width="189.2734375">Framework</th><th>Primary Focus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Andragogy</strong></td><td>Adult learning, self-direction, relevance</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Heutagogy</strong></td><td>Self-determined, learner-driven learning</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Anthropogogy</strong></td><td>Human learning across cultures and contexts</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cybergogy</strong></td><td>Learning in digital, networked, AI-mediated environments</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Geragogy</strong></td><td>Lifespan learning, aging, adaptation</td></tr></tbody></table>

Each framework captures _part_ of the learning landscape.

None, on its own, addresses the **field conditions**—emotional, relational, symbolic, and neurological—that determine whether learning is generative or defensive.

***

### How VIM Intersects With These Frameworks

VIM operates as a **cross-cutting meta-model** that explains _why_ these frameworks succeed or fail under stress.

#### Mapping VIM to Existing Pedagogical Models

<table><thead><tr><th width="160.703125">Framework</th><th>Where It Excels</th><th>Where VIM Extends It</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Andragogy</strong></td><td>Motivation, relevance, autonomy</td><td>Addresses how stress, trauma, and power dynamics constrain adult learning capacity</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Heutagogy</strong></td><td>Learner agency, self-direction</td><td>Adds guidance on <em>when</em> agency collapses under uncertainty and how to restore it</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Anthropogogy</strong></td><td>Cultural and contextual sensitivity</td><td>Integrates neuroscience of social cognition and collective trauma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cybergogy</strong></td><td>Digital and AI-mediated learning</td><td>Reframes AI as symbolic terrain requiring discernment, not just tool fluency</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Geragogy</strong></td><td>Lifespan adaptation</td><td>Connects aging, experience, and wisdom to learning under VUCA conditions</td></tr></tbody></table>

VIM does not compete with these models.\
It **stabilizes them**.

***

### Synectics and MPCM as the Integration Layer

A distinctive contribution of AoK—and now VIM—is the use of **synectics** and **MPCM (Materials–Process–Context–Meaning)** as integration mechanisms.

These tools allow learners and educators to:

* externalize internal mental models
* work indirectly with emotionally charged material
* translate between symbolic, embodied, and relational knowing

#### Synectics + MPCM as a Diagnostic Tool

<table><thead><tr><th width="139.68359375">MPCM Dimension</th><th width="248.01171875">Synectics Function</th><th>What It Reveals</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Materials</strong></td><td>Metaphor, image, symbol</td><td>Prior assumptions and subconscious models</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Process</strong></td><td>Analogical transformation</td><td>Cognitive flexibility or rigidity</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Context</strong></td><td>Reframing, displacement</td><td>Awareness of environment and power</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Meaning</strong></td><td>Reflective integration</td><td>Evidence of learning and model revision</td></tr></tbody></table>

Studio artifacts become **qualitative indicators of learning**, not decorative outputs.

***

### Trauma-Informed Framing for Institutional Contexts

In institutional settings, the term _trauma_ can unintentionally trigger resistance. VIM therefore uses **dual-labeling** to preserve accuracy while maintaining accessibility.

<table><thead><tr><th width="260.1328125">Neuroscience Term</th><th>Task-Force-Legible Translation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Trauma-informed learning</td><td>Learning under chronic stress and uncertainty</td></tr><tr><td>Survival-mode cognition</td><td>Narrowed decision-making under perceived threat</td></tr><tr><td>Dysregulated nervous system</td><td>Reduced cognitive flexibility</td></tr><tr><td>Kindness as attractor</td><td>Conditions that stabilize attention and collaboration</td></tr></tbody></table>

This is not dilution.\
It is **precision engineering for communication**.

***

### Why This Matters for Leadership and Governance

Frameworks alone do not change behavior.

**Mental models do.**

When institutions prioritize:

* linear metrics (growth, ranking, throughput)
* adversarial incentives
* surveillance-based compliance

they unintentionally cultivate:

* binary thinking
* defensive cognition
* suppression rather than exploration

VIM reframes leadership not as control of outcomes, but as **stewardship of learning conditions**.

### Glossary (Shared Language for Cross-Disciplinary Dialogue)

**Vital Intelligence (VIM)**\
A meta-model describing intelligence as emergent from embodied, relational, symbolic, and ecological interactions.

**Kindness (Functional Definition)**\
A stabilizing field condition that supports curiosity, trust, and adaptive learning under uncertainty.

**Simulationist Learning**\
Learning through iterative modeling, testing, revision, and integration rather than static rule following.

**Synectics**\
A creative cognition method using metaphor and analogy to access insight indirectly and reduce defensiveness.

**MPCM**\
A framework for understanding learning through Materials, Process, Context, and Meaning.

**Symbolic Terrain**\
The evolving landscape of language, images, narratives, and media through which meaning is negotiated.

**Discernment**\
Adaptive judgment based on relationships between factors, rather than fixed rules.

***

### Closing Orientation

The central challenge facing educational institutions in an AI-mediated era is not a lack of frameworks.

It is the **misalignment between deep human learning dynamics and the mental models used to govern them**.

VIM offers a way to:

* translate across disciplines
* integrate neuroscience without reductionism
* support leaders without moralizing
* and sustain learning in conditions of volatility

Translation, here, is not a necessary evil.\
It is an act of care.
