# AI Platforms and Concerns

{% embed url="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/dec/01/its-going-much-too-fast-the-inside-story-of-the-race-to-create-the-ultimate-ai" %}

> “The most interesting, yet challenging aspect of my job is \[working out] **how we get that balance between being really bold, moving at velocity, tremendous pace and innovation, and at the same time doing it responsibly, safely, ethically,”** said Tom Lue, a Google DeepMind vice-president with responsibility for policy, legal, safety and governance, who stopped work for 30 minutes to talk to the Guardian.
>
> Donald Trump’s White House takes a permissive approach to AI regulation and there is no comprehensive nationwide legislation in the US or the UK. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist known as a godfather of AI, said [in a Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe9QSCF-d88) this summer: “**A sandwich has more regulation than AI.”**
>
> The competitors have therefore found they bear responsibility for setting the limits of what AIs should be allowed to do.
>
> “Our calculus is not so much looking over our shoulders at what \[the other] companies are doing, but **how do we make sure that we are the ones in the lead, so that we have influence in impacting how this technology is developed and setting the norms across society,” said Lue. “You have to be in a position of strength and leadership to set that.”**
>
> “**If it’s just a race and all gas, no brakes and it’s basically a race to the bottom, that’s a terrible outcome for society,**” said Lue, who is pushing for coordinated action between the racers and governments.
>
> But strict state regulation may not be the answer either. “We support regulation that’s going to help AI be delivered to the world in a way that’s positive,” said Helen King, Google DeepMind’s vice-president for responsibility. “**The tricky part is always how do you regulate in a way that doesn’t actually slow down the good guys and give the bad guys loopholes**.”
>
> Anthropic this month [revealed](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/14/ai-anthropic-chinese-state-sponsored-cyber-attack) that its Claude Code AI, widely seen as the best system for automating computer programming, was used by a Chinese state-sponsored group in **“the first documented case of a cyber-attack largely executed without human intervention at scale”.**
>
> It sent shivers through some. “Wake the f up,” said one US senator on X. “**This is going to destroy us – sooner than we think**”. By contrast, Prof Yann LeCun, who is about to step down after 12 years as Meta’s chief AI scientist, said **Anthropic was “scaring everyone” to encourage regulation that might hinder rivals. .**
>
> **Tests of other state-of-the-art models** [**found**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14260) **they sometimes sabotaged programming intended to ensure humans can interrupt them, a worrying trait called “shutdown resistance”.**
>
> But with nearly [$2bn a week](https://www.ey.com/en_ie/newsroom/2025/06/generative-ai-vc-funding-49-2b-h1-2025-ey-report) in new venture capital investment pouring into generative AI in the first half of 2025, the pressure to realise profits will quickly rise. Tech companies realised they could make fortunes from monetising human attention on social media platforms that caused serious social problems. **The fear is that profit maximisation in the age of AGI could result in far greater adverse consequences.**\
> “It is imbalanced because it’s such a costly technology,” he said. “Early on, the companies working on AI were very open about the techniques they were using. They published, and it was quasi-academic. But then \[they] started cracking down and saying, ‘**No, we don’t want to talk about … the technology under the hood, because it’s too important to us – it’s proprietary’.”** ....he now calls on governments to create a counterweight to the huge AI firms by investing in a facility for independent, academic research. It would have a similar function to the state-funded Cern organisation for high-energy physics on the France-Switzerland border. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has [called](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/e6cd4328-673c-4e7a-8683-f63ffb2cf648_en?filename=Political%20Guidelines%202024-2029_EN.pdf) for something similar and [advocates believe](https://cfg.eu/building-cern-for-ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) it could steer the technology towards trustworthy, public interest outcomes.
>
> “**These are technologies that are going to produce the greatest boost in productivity ever seen,” Etchemendy said. “You have to make sure that the benefits are spread through society, rather than benefiting Elon Musk.”**\
> \
> They were part of a rapidly growing community of entrepreneurs hustling to apply AI to real world money-making ideas and there was zero support for any brakes on progress towards AGI to allow for its social impacts to be checked. “**We don’t do that in Silicon Valley,” said one. “If everyone here stops, it still keeps going,” said another. “It’s really hard to opt out now.”**\
> Another declared: “**Morality is best thought of as a machine-learning problem.”** Their neighbour said AI meant every cancer would be cured in 10 years. Aggressive, clever and hyped up – the young talent driving the AI boom wants it all and fast.\
> \
> Frequently you hear AI researchers say they want the push to AGI to “go well”. It is a vague phrase suggesting a wish the technology should not cause harm, but its woolliness masks trepidation.
>
> Altman has talked about “**crazy sci-fi technology becoming reality” and having “extremely deep worries about what technology is doing to kids”. He admitted: “No one knows what happens next. It’s like, we’re gonna figure this out. It’s this weird emergent thing.”**
>
> “There’s clearly real risks,” he said in an interview with the comedian Theo Von, which was short on laughs. “It kind of feels like you should be able to say something more than that, but in truth, I think all we know right now is that we have discovered … something extraordinary that is going to reshape the course of our history.”

#### Deep Fakes, AI Porn, AI Platforms, Digital Justice

{% embed url="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/dec/05/it-was-about-degrading-someone-completely-the-story-of-mr-deepfakes-the-worlds-most-notorious-ai-porn-site" %}

> In fact, that scenario was entirely possible. The origins of Mr Deepfakes stretch back to 2017-18 when AI porn was just beginning to build on social media sites such as Reddit. One anonymous Redditor and AI porn “pioneer” who went by the name of “deepfakes” (and is thus credited with coining the term) gave an [early interview](https://www.vice.com/en/article/gal-gadot-fake-ai-porn/) to Vice about its potential. Shortly after, though, in early 2018, [Reddit banned deepfake porn](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/08/reddit-bans-deepfakes-face-swap-porn-community) from its site. “We have screenshots from their message boards at that time and the deepfake community, which was small, was freaking out and jumping ship,” says Compton. This is when Mr DeepFakes was created, with the early domain name dpfks.com. The administrator carried the same username – dpfks – and was the person who advertised for volunteers to work as moderators, and posted rules and guidelines, as well as deepfake videos and an in-depth guide to using software for deepfake porn.\
> “What’s so depressing about reading the messages and seeing the genesis is realising how easily governments could have stopped this in its tracks,” says Compton. “The people doing it didn’t believe they were going to be allowed free rein. They were saying: ‘They’re coming for us!’, ‘They’re never going to let us do this!’ But as they continued without any problems at all, you see this growing emboldenment.\
> On 4 May, Mr DeepFakes shut down. A notice on its homepage blamed “data loss” caused by the withdrawal of a “critical service provider”. “We will not be relaunching,” it continued. “Any website claiming this is fake. This domain will eventually expire and we are not responsible for future use. This message will be removed in about a week.”\
> “After Mr DeepFakes shut down, I got an automatic email from one of them which said: “If you want anything made, let me know … Mr DeepFakes is down – but of course, we keep working.”

> The Data (Use and Access) Act, which received royal assent in June, has made the creation of a deepfake intimate image without consent a criminal offence and also criminalised requesting others to create the deepfake image – as her best friend had when he posted images of Jodie on forums. Both now carry a custodial sentence of up to six months, as well as an unlimited fine. It’s a huge victory won fast in a space where progress has been mind-bendingly slow. However, this isn’t the story of a new government determined to tackle an ever-evolving crime. It was fought for and pushed through by a small group of victims and experts who formed a WhatsApp group called Heroes.\
> Owen organised a core group of experts and campaigners, which included Clare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University; [the Revenge Porn Helpline](https://revengepornhelpline.org.uk/); [Not Your Porn](https://notyourporn.com/); [MyImageMyChoice](https://myimagemychoice.org/); the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW); and survivors such as Jodie. They formed a tight team in the WhatsApp group Owen set up, aiming to criminalise the creation and requesting of deepfake intimate image abuse.\
> &#x20;Elena Michael, co-founder of [Not Your Porn](https://notyourporn.com/), which supports victims of intimate image abuse and campaigns for change, agrees. “For a decade, the victims and experts working in the field have been kept in separate rooms to the people making the laws, and the laws we’ve had just haven’t worked,” she says. “**When the government doesn’t listen to survivors, they’re not just devaluing their experience, they’re also discarding their expertise. These women have had to fight for years. There’s nothing they don’t know about what change is needed.**\
> **It criminalised the making of sexually explicit deepfakes and the requesting of them. It was consent-based – if the deepfake was made without consent, it was a crime; the intentions behind it made no difference**. It included forced deletion – anyone convicted of creating a deepfake image would be forced to delete it. This was crucial, given one victim’s experience when, after a conviction for intimate image abuse, police returned devices to her perpetrator with the images still on them. “Every single line represented a woman’s real experience,” says Owen.\
> “Still, this is significant progress,” she adds. “We’re now able to say, **‘Creating this stuff without consent is wrong.’ It’s unlawful and it’s wrong. The message is clear and that’s great.”**

### **Child Advocacy and AI Concerns**

**Fairplay:**  [https://fairplayforkids.org/](https://fairplayforkids.org/)

> For over 25 years, Fairplay has been the leading voice fighting to enhance children’s well-being by eliminating the exploitative and harmful business practices of marketers and Big Tech. **Join us to create a world where kids can be kids!**&#x20;

Thorn.org: [https://www.thorn.org/](https://www.thorn.org/)\
We’re building a digital safety net to protect children. At Thorn, we put technology to work each day to enhance child safety. Thanks to a combination of donor support and earned revenue, we can focus our efforts across four key pillars to protect children from harm in the digital age:

### Labor and AI Concerns:

{% embed url="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/28/amazon-ai-climate-change" %}

> The letter contains a range of demands for [Amazon](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon), concerning its impact on the workplace and the environment. Staffers are calling on the company to power all its data centers with clean energy, make sure its AI-powered products and services do not enable “violence, surveillance and mass deportation”, and form a working group comprised of non-managers “that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact”.\
> Workers emphasized they are not against AI outright, rather they want it to be developed sustainably and with input from the people building and using it. “I see Amazon using AI to justify a power grab over community resources like water and energy, but also over its own workers, who are increasingly subject to surveillance, work speedups, and implicit threats of layoffs,” said the senior software engineer. “There is a culture of fear around openly discussing the drawbacks of AI at work, and one thing the letter is setting out to accomplish is to show our colleagues that many of us feel this way and that another path is possible.”

### AI Leadership & Media

{% embed url="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/29/big-tech-silicon-valley-ceo-media" %}

> At a time when the majority of [Americans distrust](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/04/29/americans-views-of-technology-companies-2/) [big tech](https://techoversight.org/2025/06/11/tech-ceo-poll-25/) and [believe artificial intelligence will harm society](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/09/17/how-americans-view-ai-and-its-impact-on-people-and-society/), Silicon Valley has built its own network of alternative media where CEOs, founders and investors are the unchallenged and beloved stars. What was once the province of a few fawning podcasters has grown into a fully fledged ecosystem of publications and shows supported by some of the tech industry’s most powerful.\
> The a16z Substack also announced this month that the firm was launching an eight-week new media fellowship for “operators, creators, and storytellers shaping the future of media”. The fellowship includes collaborating with a16z’s new media operation, which it describes as being made up of “online legends” creating a “single place where founders acquire the legitimacy, taste, brandbuilding, expertise, and momentum they need to win the narrative battle online”.
>
> In addition to a16z’s media effort, Palantir launched a digital and print publication earlier this year called the Republic that mimics academic journals and thinktank-style magazines like Foreign Affairs. The journal is funded by the Palantir Foundation for Defense Policy and International Affairs, a non-profit where Karp is the chair, though he only works there 0.01 hours per week, according to 2023 tax filings.
>
> “Far too many people who should not have a platform do. And there are far too many people who should have a platform but do not,” states the Republic, which has an editorial team made up of senior Palantir executives.\
> Even if much of this new media isn’t aiming to expose wrongdoing or challenge people in power, it is not exactly without value. The content that the tech industry is creating is frequently a reflection of how its elites see themselves and the world they want to build – one with less government regulation and fewer probing questions on how their companies are run. Even the most banal questions can also be a glimpse into the heads of people who exist primarily in guarded board rooms and gated compounds.
