> “This latest ploy by the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) to dismantle the congressionally created US Department of Education is not only unlawful – it’s an insult to the tens of millions of students who rely on the agency to protect their access to a quality education,” said Rachel Gittleman, president of AFGE Local 252 and a worker at the agency. “Students, educators and families depend on the department’s comprehensive support for schools, from early learning through graduate programs.
>
> “This move comes as the administration has attempted to fire large numbers of career public servants in these very offices – and is now trying to shift their critical work to agencies with no educational expertise. Breaking apart the Department of Education and moving its responsibilities elsewhere will only create more confusion for schools and colleges, deepen public distrust, and ultimately harm students and families.”

> The survey interviewed nearly 4,000 faculty across the southern U.S., including more than 1,100 from Texas. About a quarter of the Texas professors said they have applied for higher education jobs in other states in the last two years, and more than 25% said they soon intend to start searching for out-of-state positions. Of those who aren’t thinking of leaving, more than one-fifth said they don’t plan to stay in higher education in the long-term.

> Hahrie Han, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University and a 2025 MacArthur fellow, warned that organizing thus far has mostly engaged like-minded people. The next step must include organizing in places where people may not agree. There’s also a need to supply more opportunities for people to get involved, and to help people learn to organize themselves for what their needs are, she said.
