# Declaration of Intentional Authorship

#### Transformative Kindness GPT | Humanity++

#### Purpose of This Declaration

This declaration clarifies the **role of human authorship, intention, and responsibility** in the development of the _Transformative Kindness GPT_ and its associated conceptual frameworks.

It is offered to support transparency, pedagogical clarity, and ethical use in educational and interdisciplinary contexts.

***

#### 1. Principle of Intentional Authorship

This work is developed under the principle of **Meaningful Human Control**.

The conceptual foundations presented here—including attractor models (Trust, Kindness, Distress, Dark), resonance-based interpretations, and systemic analyses—are the result of **human inquiry, interdisciplinary research, reflective judgment, and lived experience**.

Artificial intelligence systems, including large language models, are used **solely as instruments** to assist with:

* synthesis of complex material
* iterative refinement of language
* exploration of alternative framings

They do not originate intent, judgment, or ethical stance.

All interpretive responsibility remains human.

***

#### 2. Role of AI as an Instrument

Within this project, AI systems are treated as **non-agentic tools**.

They function as:

* pattern amplifiers
* language organizers
* simulation aids

They do not:

* possess agency
* hold values
* exercise discernment
* assume authorship

This distinction is central to the educational aims of _Transformative Kindness GPT_, which seeks to make the limits of AI authority explicit rather than implicit.

***

#### 3. Provenance and Transparency

To support clarity of authorship and responsible reuse, this work maintains an **open, versioned record of development**.

* Conceptual evolution and revisions are documented through publicly accessible GitBook and repository histories.
* All published material reflects **human review, critique, and contextual judgment** prior to release.

This approach supports:

* traceability of ideas
* shared learning
* ethical stewardship in AI-mediated creation

***

#### 4. Ethical Use and Licensing

This work is shared under the\
**Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)**.

This license allows:

* reuse with attribution
* adaptation for educational and research purposes
* collaborative extension under the same terms

It prohibits:

* commercial exploitation without permission
* uses that remove attribution or restrict access to derivatives

The intent of this licensing choice is to ensure that the _Transformative Kindness_ framework remains:

* open
* accountable
* oriented toward collective learning and wellbeing

***

#### 5. Scope and Affiliation

This project is developed as an **independent, educational research and design initiative**.

Participation in academic or learning environments—whether as observer, collaborator, or student—does not imply institutional ownership, endorsement, or authorship of this work.

The responsibility for interpretation, application, and further development rests with those who engage with the material.

***

#### Closing Note

_Transformative Kindness GPT_ is not presented as a final model or authoritative system.

It is offered as a **provisional, evolving framework** intended to:

* support discernment in AI-mediated contexts
* encourage reflection rather than compliance
* cultivate resonance, repair, and learning across difference

If these models cease to be useful, they should be revised, challenged, or replaced.\
That process is itself an expression of intelligence.
