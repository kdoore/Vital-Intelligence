# How to Collaborate With This Work

### Integrity, Trust, and Non-Extractive Contribution

#### Purpose of This Page

This page outlines **how collaboration is invited, supported, and bounded** within the _Humanity++ / Vital Intelligence Model_ ecosystem.

Because this work addresses power, trust, and AI-mediated systems, collaboration itself must be **designed with care**. Clear expectations help prevent misunderstanding, extraction, or unintentional harm—while supporting curiosity, contribution, and shared learning.

***

### Collaboration as a Practice, Not a Transaction

Collaboration here is understood as a **relational process**, not an exchange of outputs.

Participants are invited to engage as:

* co-learners
* reflective contributors
* stewards of meaning

Rather than as:

* content consumers
* extractive users
* representatives of institutional authority

This distinction matters for maintaining resonance and trust.

***

### Who Is Welcome to Collaborate

Collaboration is open to:

* students and educators
* researchers and practitioners
* artists, designers, technologists
* institutional task forces and working groups

No prior alignment with conclusions is required.\
Curiosity, care, and reflective capacity are sufficient.

***

### Modes of Collaboration

Collaboration may take many forms, including:

* thoughtful critique and questions
* adaptation of frameworks for new contexts
* studio-based experimentation
* case studies and reflections
* diagrams, exercises, or alternative representations
* documentation of failures and limitations

Contributions may be small or exploratory.\
They do not need to be polished or definitive.

***

### Expectations for Collaborative Engagement

To support integrity and shared learning, collaborators are asked to:

* **Preserve authorship clarity**\
  Credit sources and describe how ideas are extended or reinterpreted.
* **Maintain human discernment**\
  Do not delegate judgment or ethical responsibility to AI systems.
* **Avoid extractive reuse**\
  Contributions should not strip context, intent, or attribution.
* **Respect provisionality**\
  Treat all models as evolving, not authoritative.
* **Name uncertainty and limits**\
  Ambiguity is part of the work, not a failure.

These expectations reflect the **Kindness and Trust attractors** described in KAMM.

***

### Trust, Boundaries, and Discernment

Trust is essential for collaboration, but it is not unconditional.

Healthy collaboration includes:

* openness to dialogue
* willingness to revise
* clarity about roles and scope
* respect for boundaries

When collaboration begins to:

* pressure alignment
* seek authority capture
* erase provenance
* prioritize speed over care

it may be paused or redirected.

This is a normal and necessary part of maintaining integrity.

***

### Relationship to Institutions

This work may be engaged within institutional contexts, but collaboration does not imply:

* institutional ownership
* endorsement
* delegated authority
* or transfer of responsibility

Institutions are welcome as **participants**, not governors.

***

### How to Begin Collaborating

If you wish to collaborate:

* Start with a specific page, diagram, or question
* Describe the context in which you are working
* Name what you hope to explore or test
* Share constraints, concerns, or uncertainties

Clear intent supports resonance.

***

### How Collaboration Is Documented

When appropriate, collaboration may be documented through:

* version history
* acknowledgments
* reflective notes
* linked derivative works

This transparency supports collective learning and protects against misinterpretation.

***

### Closing Framing

Collaboration within Humanity++ is guided by a simple principle:

> **Contribute in ways that leave others more capable of discernment, not more dependent on authority.**

Trust opens collaboration.\
Kindness stabilizes it.\
Discernment sustains it.
