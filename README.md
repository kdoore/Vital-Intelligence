# VIM: Transformative Bridging

## AI Literacy Framework - VIM Transformative Bridging

_A practical and theoretical resource for educators, learners, and organizations navigating AI-mediated disruption_

***

### Welcome

This section introduces the **Bridge Checklist** — a practical AI literacy framework designed for humans learning to navigate information environments that are volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous.

It is built on a simple but consequential premise: most AI literacy programs ask _how do I use this tool correctly?_ This one asks _what do I do when something goes wrong — and how do I learn from it?_

That shift — from tool mastery to event triage — changes everything about how the curriculum is designed, who it serves, and what it produces.

### Who this is for

This framework was designed to be accessible across contexts. You do not need a technical background. You do not need to agree with any particular position on AI development. You need only a genuine interest in understanding your own information environment more clearly — and a willingness to practice.

**College students and educators** will find complete session designs, facilitation guides, and teaching cases ready to use.

**Business leaders and organizational teams** will find a diagnostic framework for understanding where AI-mediated disruption is creating vulnerability in decision-making, communication, and trust.

**Community members and lifelong learners** will find plain-language explanations, practical exercises, and a conceptual map for understanding what is happening in the information environment around them.

**Researchers and practitioners** will find the theoretical foundations, annotated bibliography, and connections to the deeper Vital Intelligence Model research documented in the sections below.

### What you will find in this section

The section is organized as a learning spiral — each page builds on the previous one, but each one also stands alone.

[**A Note on How This Framework Was Made**](vim-ai-literacy-framework/vim-transformative-bridging/pedagogical-philosophy.md) The authorship statement and origin story. Why this framework is trauma-informed, why it uses art and play, and what it is ultimately trying to develop.

[**Start Here: The Entry Question**](vim-ai-literacy-framework/vim-transformative-bridging/entry-question.md) The accessible entry point. One question that opens the whole framework without requiring any prior knowledge.

[**The Framework: Three Panels, One Cycle**](vim-ai-literacy-framework/vim-transformative-bridging/framework-overview.md) The complete Bridge Checklist explained in plain language. Gyroscope, Radar, Compass — what each one does and why the sequence matters.

[**Session Design: The Article Exercise**](vim-ai-literacy-framework/vim-transformative-bridging/session-design.md) A complete four-session facilitation guide for instructors, including how to handle polarization in the room, guidance for older adult learners, and the role of humor as pedagogy.

[**Theoretical Foundations**](vim-ai-literacy-framework/vim-transformative-bridging/theoretical-foundations.md) Layer 2 depth — PSI theory, Neutrosophic Logic, Active Inference, Multilevel Selection, Ostrom's principles, and the modeling and simulation framework that underlies the whole approach.

[**Teaching Cases: Four Articles, One Learning Spiral**](vim-ai-literacy-framework/teaching-cases-index/) Complete facilitation guides for four articles representing different panel emphases and emotional registers, sequenced as a complete course arc.

**Situating the Framework: The Larger Transformation** The iceberg beneath the Bridge Checklist — the structural argument about misplaced trust, the control-flow to living systems shift, and the thermodynamic case for kindness as collective survival strategy.

### The relationship between this section and VIM

The Bridge Checklist is the applied, accessible expression of a deeper theoretical body of work: the **Vital Intelligence Model (VIM)**, documented in the sections below this one.

VIM provides the theoretical architecture — the multi-model holarchic framework, the consciousness science foundations, the complexity theory, the organizational evolution research. The Bridge Checklist translates that architecture into a practice that can be used in a 45-minute session with college students, a corporate team, or a community group.

You do not need to read VIM to use the Bridge Checklist. But if you find yourself wanting to understand _why_ the framework is structured the way it is — why stabilization precedes interpretation, why externalities are a panel-level concern rather than an add-on, why kindness is a structural rather than sentimental claim — the answers are in VIM.

Think of this section as the door. VIM is the building.

### A living framework

This section is actively under development. Pages will be added, refined, and updated as the framework is tested in real educational and organizational contexts.

If you use this material, adapt it, or find yourself arguing with it — that is exactly what it is designed to produce. Feedback and collaboration are welcome through the Get Involved section.
