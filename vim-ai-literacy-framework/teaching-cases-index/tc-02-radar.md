## The article

**Title:** The Film Students Who Can No Longer Sit Through Films; AI Vibe Reporting\
**Author:** Cal Newport\
**Source:**[ Personal newsletter, February 2026](https://calnewport.com/film-students-can-no-longer-sit-through-films/)\
**Subject:** Two related diagnoses — the erosion of "cognitive patience" through smartphone habit loops, and "vibe reporting" in AI journalism that implies causation through juxtaposition without directly claiming it.

## What this article does

Newport is practicing Radar skills in public. His "vibe reporting" walkthrough is a real-time source audit — he takes specific sentences from an Atlantic article about AI and jobs, names the logical fallacy operating in each one, and distinguishes between what is directly claimed and what is implied through framing.

This makes the article unusually useful as a teaching case: students can watch someone perform the Radar capacity and then practice it themselves using the same techniques on a different article.

The emotional register is analytical and mildly validating — most readers feel recognized rather than distressed. That makes it the right second session: the group has already practiced sitting with difficulty in Session 1. Now they practice thinking carefully.

## Session structure (45–60 minutes)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Opening check-in (5 minutes)

Return to Session 1 commitments.\
Did you do the thing you said? What happened? What did you notice?

This is not evaluation. It is establishing that the commitment artifact matters — that the gap between sessions is also learning time. Keep it brief. Three or four people sharing is enough.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Somatic check-in (2 minutes)

Notice your state right now before we begin. This article is analytically demanding. If you're tired or scattered, that's useful information about what your Radar is working with today.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Radar pass — primary (20 minutes)

Read Newport's "vibe reporting" section together, slowly. His walkthrough covers four specific claims from the Atlantic article. For each one, ask:

* What is directly stated?
* What is implied?
* What evidence would be needed to support the implication?

After reading, ask the group: what technique is Newport using here? Let them name it before you name it. They will likely arrive at: checking sources, separating feeling from fact, following the logic of the argument rather than its emotional pull.

Introduce the framework vocabulary: this is **Signal Coverage** — tracking where information comes from, who benefits from you believing it, and what would need to be true for the implication to hold.

Walk through Newport's specific examples using the Radar questions:

* Where did this claim come from, and what evidence supports it?
* Who benefits from me believing this?
* What is the article implying without directly stating?
* What would shift my assessment if I discovered it was true?

Teach the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy — "after this, therefore because of this." It's common in AI journalism; recognizing it is a transferable Radar skill.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Uncertainty pass — secondary (10 minutes)

Read Newport's calibrated conclusion about AI and jobs: "Generative AI might very well create broad disruptions in the job market. But we're not there yet. The first major shift will likely occur in software development, but its magnitude remains unclear."

Ask: What does it feel like to read that conclusion? Is it satisfying? Frustrating? Reassuring?

Name the discomfort many feel with calibrated uncertainty without judging it — the preference for a clear verdict either way is itself data about **U (uncertainty) capacity**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Gyroscope connection — brief (5 minutes)

Newport's "cognitive patience" diagnosis is a Gyroscope observation in different language. His description of smartphone habit loops — neuronal bundles firing in the short-term reward system, creating "a cascade of neurochemicals experienced as motivation to grab the phone" — is a plain-language account of dysregulation.

His prescription (remove the competing stimulus, build capacity incrementally, anchor in meaningful content) is a Gyroscope intervention.

Ask: Notice right now whether you feel the pull to check something else. That pull is data about your current regulation state, not a character flaw.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Compass pass and commitment artifact (8 minutes)

Newport's film-watching prescription is a small, specific, verifiable kind action — not a policy position, not a grand gesture. It is the **V (verify) capacity** applied to personal attention management: a small pilot, a testable hypothesis, a commitment to observe results.

Commitment artifact prompt: Identify one attention practice you will try before Session 3 — analog, embodied, sustained. Name what you're hoping to learn from it. It can be watching a film, reading a physical book, taking a walk without your phone, or any practice that builds sustained presence.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## The AI literacy thread

Newport's newsletter trains students to apply Radar skills to AI discourse itself. Most AI journalism is written in the vibe reporting mode — emotionally activating, implication-heavy, evidence-light. This is not necessarily dishonesty; the attention economy rewards activation, and _**uncertainty**_ does not activate.

A student who can read an AI news article the way Newport reads that Atlantic piece has developed a transferable skill that will remain useful regardless of how AI develops. The specific claims will change; the logical patterns will not.

## Connecting Sessions 1 and 2

Session 1 showed what happens when an algorithm optimizes for engagement without accountability. Session 2 shows how that same optimization shapes the journalism that covers AI — the very journalism students use to form opinions about the systems from Session 1.

Make the connection explicit: the same mechanism that served that teenage girl misogynistic content is shaping the information environment you use to understand AI. What does that mean for how you read AI news?

## Facilitator notes

{% hint style="info" %}
On Newport's audience: Newport writes primarily for knowledge workers with enough material stability to think about attention optimization. Some students may feel this article is not for them. That friction is worth exploring: who gets to practice cognitive patience, and under what conditions? Is attention autonomy a privilege?
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
On practicing the skill: After the walkthrough, give students 10 minutes to apply the same techniques to a different article they find. This is the most important practice move in the session — going from watching the skill to performing it.
