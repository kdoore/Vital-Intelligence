## The article

**Title:**[ Less snow, or more risk? What you need to know about avalanches and climate change](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/22/avalanches-climate-change-extreme-weather-ski-resorts)\
**Author:** Ajit Niranjan\
**Source:** _The Guardian_, February 22, 2026\
**Subject:** The relationship between climate change and avalanche risk — a science article that models calibrated uncertainty with precision, naming what is known, what is uncertain, and what the mechanisms are.

## What this article does

This article is different from the previous three in a specific and important way: it demonstrates good epistemic behavior. It does not vibe report. It does not catastrophize or dismiss. It cites named researchers with named institutional affiliations. It distinguishes between what the data shows (steady death rates despite increased exposure), what the models project (fewer but potentially more intense events at high elevation), and what remains genuinely uncertain (magnitude, timing, local variation).

That makes it a meta-teaching case — an article that teaches the Radar capacity by modeling it, rather than requiring students to apply it against the grain of the writing.

It is also the article that provides the physical science of the course's central metaphor.

## Session structure (45–60 minutes)

Use the following sequence for a 45–60 minute session.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Opening — full spiral check-in (10 minutes)

This is the final session of the arc. Open with a fuller check-in than previous sessions.

Three questions to ask each participant:

* What did you learn across these four sessions that surprised you?
* What changed in how you read or interact with information?
* What are you still sitting with that hasn't resolved?

Allow more time here than usual. The unresolved questions are often the most important learning.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### The article as model (20 minutes)

* Read the article together.
* Ask: How does this article feel different from the previous three?

Let students name differences before you name them. Expect observations such as:

* Multiple named sources with institutional affiliations
* Explicit distinction between what is measured and what is modeled
* Acknowledgment of uncertainty without collapse into "we don't know anything"
* Genuine complexity held without forcing a simple conclusion

Introduce the concept of epistemic virtue — writing that respects the reader's capacity to hold complexity.

Walk through specific examples from the article (paraphrase or quote short passages):

* "This massive decrease in risk cannot be explained by climate change. Other factors, such as faster rescue operations and better avalanche forecasts, appear to be far more important." — a researcher directly qualifying the expected narrative.
* "The model projections show a general decrease in the frequency of heavy snowfall events, but an intensification of events is possible, especially at high elevations." — holds a general trend and a specific exception simultaneously.

Activity: Ask students to rewrite one paragraph from the article in vibe-reporting mode. This deliberate exercise of worsening epistemic behavior often teaches more than only reading good examples.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Full three-panel pass — student-led (15 minutes)

For the first time in the series, let students lead the panel passes rather than the facilitator.

Divide into three groups. Each group takes one panel and runs the analysis:

* Gyroscope group: How does this article land in the body? What emotional state does it produce, and what does that tell us about the information?
* Radar group: What is the signal coverage here? What is known, uncertain, absent? Who benefits from the conclusions?
* Compass group: What kind action is available from here? What does the avalanche science suggest about preparation, warning systems, and community response?

Groups share briefly. The facilitator's role is to connect the three passes into one integrated reading.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### The avalanche metaphor — closing (10 minutes)

Name the course's central metaphor explicitly and let students complete it.

Share physical science from the article:

* Avalanches are triggered by small disturbances in unstable systems.
* Deaths have declined despite increased exposure because of better warnings, faster rescue operations, and community education.
* Snowpack structure — the presence or absence of weak layers formed early — is often more determinative than the size of the triggering event.

Ask: How does this physical description map onto what we've been learning?

Expected mappings:

* Information environment as snowpack (weak layers form early from chronic low-grade exposure)
* Recommendation algorithm as wind or weight (a small disturbance in an already unstable system)
* Gyroscope as weak layer assessment (knowing the structure of the system before entering it)
* Avalanche of Kindness as a cascade triggered intentionally in prepared conditions by people who know what they're doing

Key insight: Avalanche education has held death rates steady despite massive increases in exposure. That is evidence that VUCA preparation works. It does not prevent cascades, but it changes the conditions under which they occur and the capacity of communities to respond.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Final commitment artifact — the learning document (10 minutes)

Rather than a commitment to a specific action, the final artifact is a learning document — one page, any format, kept by the student. It should capture:

* One thing that changed in how you read or interact with information
* One article, source, or information environment you will approach differently
* One collective action, organization, or community you are now more aware of
* One question you are still sitting with

These stay private to the student and become the start of their Signal Coverage log — a practice of noticing their information environment rather than simply being moved by it.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## The physical science of the Avalanche of Kindness

The avalanche metaphor has guided the development of this framework for years. The physical science clarifies why.

* Weak layers form when early-season conditions create unstable structure within the snowpack. Once buried under subsequent snowfall, they persist invisibly and create conditions for human-triggered events long after the original formation. The information equivalent: chronic early exposure to dysregulating content creates persistent weak layers in nervous system regulation and epistemic capacity. These are not dramatic traumas. They are cumulative conditions.
* Triggering is often surprisingly small. A skier's weight, a gust of wind, a temperature shift. The size of the trigger is less important than the stability of the system. The information equivalent: a single activating article, a single AI output, a single social interaction can trigger a cascade in a system already primed for it.
* Education and preparation have held death rates steady despite a massive increase in exposure. The mechanism: better warnings (Radar), faster rescue operations (co-regulation and Connection), community knowledge of local conditions (Signal Coverage), and changed behavior in response to hazard bulletins (Validation). These are the same capacities the framework develops.
* The Avalanche of Kindness is not a metaphor for gentle accumulation. It is a cascade dynamic — potentially rapid, potentially large, triggered by small intentional acts in systems that have been prepared to receive them. The preparation is the curriculum.

## Facilitator notes

* On the full arc: By this session, students have practiced all three panels with three different articles and different emotional registers. The student-led panel pass in this session is a genuine assessment — not graded, but observable. Can they run the analysis without scaffolding?
* On unresolved questions: The questions students are still sitting with at the end of Session 4 are your curriculum for the next iteration. Collect them (with permission) and use them to refine the article selection and facilitation approach.
* On continuing practice: The framework is not a course you complete. It is a practice you develop. The most useful closing move is to name that directly and give students a simple ongoing practice: once a week, apply the three Radar questions to one article they encounter naturally.
  * Where did this come from?
  * Who benefits from me believing it?
  * What does it hide?

That practice, maintained over time, is the information immune system the framework is designed to build.

## Using learner-selected articles (optional, for longer courses)

In courses with more than four sessions, Session 4 becomes the template rather than the conclusion. Students bring their own articles and run the panel passes in small groups. The facilitator observes, asks questions, and occasionally names patterns across the articles the group is bringing.

Over time, the group develops a collective Radar — a shared capacity to notice the information environment they are embedded in and respond to it rather than simply being moved by it. That collective Radar is the Avalanche of Kindness in development.
