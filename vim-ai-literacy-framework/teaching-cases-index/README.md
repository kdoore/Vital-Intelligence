## How to use this section

Each page in this section provides a complete facilitation guide for one article, organized around the Bridge Checklist's three panels. The four articles are sequenced as a learning spiral — each one emphasizes a different panel as its primary entry point, and each one is slightly more cognitively and emotionally demanding than the last.

Used together across a four-session course, they move students from personal recognition through analytical skill through systemic thinking through integrative practice.

Used individually, each one is a complete 45–60 minute session.

## The four articles and their primary panel emphasis

[**Session 1 — Gyroscope**](tc-01-gyroscope.md) **entry (high activation, personal)**\
[Anonymous, 15 · _The Guardian_ · February 2026](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/23/15-year-old-girl-misogyny-social-media-online-abuse)\
&#xNAN;_&#x4F;bjectification, hate, rape threats: what I see every day on social media_\
A teenage girl's testimony about the daily information environment she cannot escape.\
**Primary skill:** Stabilizing before interpreting. Recognizing nervous system state as the prerequisite for clear thinking.

***

[**Session 2 — Radar**](tc-02-radar.md) **entry (analytical, medium activation)**\
[Cal Newport · Newsletter · February 2026](https://calnewport.com/film-students-can-no-longer-sit-through-films/)\
&#xNAN;_&#x46;ilm students who can't sit through films; "vibe reporting" about AI and jobs_\
A media critic diagnoses attention erosion and demonstrates source auditing in real time.\
**Primary skill:** Signal coverage. Distinguishing implication from evidence. Calibrating uncertainty without forcing closure.

***

[**Session 3 — Compass**](tc-03-compass.md) **entry (systemic, politically activating)**\
[Eduardo Porter · _The Guardian_ · February 2026](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/23/ai-how-will-we-be-fed)\
&#xNAN;_&#x48;ow will we be fed? The unasked question about AI and economic power_\
A journalist names the governance vacuum at the center of AI development and asks who decides.\
**Primary skill:** Externalities visibility at systemic scale. Kind action when individual action is insufficient. Holding political activation without collapsing into tribal certainty.

***

[**Session 4 — Integration**](tc-04-integration.md) **(learner-selected, full cycle)**\
[Avalanche dynamics · _The Guardian_ · February 2026](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/22/avalanches-climate-change-extreme-weather-ski-resorts)\
&#xNAN;_&#x4C;ess snow, or more risk? Avalanches and climate change_\
A science article that models calibrated uncertainty — and provides the metaphorical language for the entire framework.\
**Primary skill:** Full cycle practice. Recognizing good epistemic behavior in writing. Connecting individual learning to systemic resonance.

## What the progression teaches

Each article is progressively more demanding, but the demand shifts in nature across the spiral.

* Session 1 demands _**emotional presence**_ — the ability to receive testimony without intellectualizing it away.
* Session 2 demands _**analytical patience**_ — the ability to follow an argument carefully without being captured by its emotional valence.
* Session 3 demands _**systemic imagination**_ — the ability to hold civilizational-scale questions without either dismissing them or collapsing into helplessness.
* Session 4 demands _**integrative synthesis**_ — the ability to recognize the framework operating in a piece of writing that has nothing to do with AI literacy, and to use that recognition to articulate your own learning.

Together they constitute one complete turn of the learning spiral: stabilize → widen → act with integrity → learn and update.

## The avalanche metaphor as through-line

The final article is also a gift to the whole course: it provides the physical science of the Avalanche of Kindness metaphor. Real avalanches are triggered by small disturbances in unstable systems. Deaths have declined despite increased exposure because of better warnings, faster rescue, and community education. Cascade dynamics can be catastrophic or lifesaving depending on the conditions and the preparation.

The framework is an avalanche preparation curriculum. Not to prevent the cascade — cascades are inevitable in unstable systems. To prepare people to trigger the right ones, survive the dangerous ones, and learn from all of them.
