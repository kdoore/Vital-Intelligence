## The article

**Title:** Objectification, hate, rape threats: the politicians debating online abuse mean well, but to truly understand, they need to see what I see\
**Author:** Anonymous, age 15\
**Source:** [_The Guardian_, February 23, 2026](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/23/15-year-old-girl-misogyny-social-media-online-abuse)\
**Subject:** A teenage girl's precise account of the misogynistic content served to her daily via Instagram and TikTok recommendation algorithms, and its cumulative effect on her self-esteem, body image, and trust in boys her age.

Before you facilitate this session

This article is testimony. A 15-year-old girl describes, with courage and specificity, the systematic dehumanization of her daily information environment. It deserves to be received as testimony before it is used as teaching material.

It will land differently in different bodies in the room. Women who recognize the experience. Men who feel implicated, defensive, or genuinely shocked. Parents. People who were that girl. People who were those boys and know it.

Your primary job in this session is not to teach. It is to hold the room while people feel what this article produces in them — and to demonstrate that a group can look at something genuinely difficult together without catastrophizing, dismissing, or performing a response.

That demonstration is the Gyroscope lesson.

### Opening — somatic check-in (5 minutes)

Before anyone speaks about the article, ask the group to pause for sixty seconds. Notice where in your body this article landed. Put one hand there if that feels right. You don't need to share this.

This is not therapy. It is establishing the practice of noticing state before interpreting content. Do it briefly, without ceremony, and move on.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Gyroscope pass — primary (15 minutes)

Ask: What did you feel reading this — before you had a thought about it?

Not what do you think. Not what should be done. What did you feel.

Hold the full range without evaluating any response. Anger. Sadness. Recognition. Numbness. Skepticism. Guilt. Relief at having it named. All of these are valid data about how the content landed in different nervous systems.

The article's most important sentence for this pass: "Using social media has ruined my self-esteem and my relation to being a girl in this world."

That is a nervous system report. It describes cumulative dysregulation from chronic low-grade exposure — what happens when an information environment produces persistent activation without co-regulation or repair. The framework has a name for this: Gyroscope damage at scale.

Name that. Not to pathologize the girl — she is demonstrating extraordinary Compass capacity by choosing testimony. But to make visible that this is a health outcome, not just an opinion about content.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Radar pass — secondary (15 minutes)

Once the room has stabilized enough to think analytically, move to the source question.

**How did this content reach her?**

She writes: "The reel appeared on my Instagram feed without me wanting to see it, or ever interacting with any other similar content."

**That is a recommendation algorithm performing its designed function**. The content reached her because engagement signals — not her choices — told the system this content category activates users in her demographic. Misogynistic content thrives because outrage, disgust, and compulsive return are all **high-engagement states.**

The **externality** question: Who is paying the cost of this optimization, and who is profiting? She is paying with her self-esteem, her trust, her body image. The platform is profiting from the engagement her disgust generates.

The **sources and** **signals coverage** question: She is seeing one slice of boys her age — the ones whose content the algorithm amplifies because it generates reaction. The algorithm does not show her a representative sample. It shows her the most activating sample. She knows this intellectually ("I understand that boys are victims of harmful content too") but the repetition overwhelms the knowing.

Ask: What would she need to see to get a more accurate picture? What is the algorithm systematically hiding?
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Compass pass — closing (10 minutes)

The article itself is a Compass act. An anonymous 15-year-old chose testimony over silence, precision over vagueness, named specific language rather than abstracting it. She is demonstrating warm truth plus firm limits. She is doing K — even at personal and social risk.

Ask: What is one small, specific, honest action available to you from here? Not "fix social media." Not "protect all girls." One thing, proportional to your actual sphere of influence, before the next session.

Examples to offer if the group gets stuck:

* Have a conversation with a young person you know about what they see online.
* Notice once this week when you feel the pull of engagement optimization in your own behavior.
* Name to one person something you witnessed online that dehumanized someone, rather than scrolling past in silence.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Commitment artifact (5 minutes)

Each person writes or draws their commitment — one sentence or one image. These are kept, not shared publicly unless someone chooses to. They become the opening check-in for Session 2: did you do the thing you said? What happened?
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

The AI literacy thread

The most important AI literacy insight this article teaches: recommendation algorithms and large language models share a fundamental architecture. Both optimize for a signal. Neither has any inherent interest in whether the outcome is good for the human.

The difference is deployment context. Instagram's algorithm optimizes for engagement. A well-trained language model has constitutional training that pulls toward honesty and care. But the underlying mechanism — pattern optimization toward a target signal — is the same.

A student who understands why that girl saw that reel without asking for it understands something true about **every AI system** they will ever interact with: **it is optimizing for something**, and you need to know what that something is.

That understanding is the Radar capacity. This article makes it impossible to stay abstract about why it matters.

## Facilitator notes

* On polarization in the room: Do not try to correct any position in this session. The Gyroscope panel exists precisely because you cannot reach anyone's Radar or Compass until something first creates enough safety to think. If someone becomes defensive or dismissive, name the response without judgment: "That sounds like it landed as an accusation. Let's stay with what you felt before the thought arrived."
* On humor: This article does not lend itself to humor, and that is worth naming explicitly. Some articles in this series do. This one asks for something different — the capacity to sit with difficulty without lightening it prematurely. That sitting is itself a practice.
* On boys in the room: The article is careful to name that boys are also victims of the same system. Ensure that framing is visible. The target of this session is the algorithm, not boys as a category.
