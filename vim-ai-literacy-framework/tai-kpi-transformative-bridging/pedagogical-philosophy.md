# Pedagogical philosophy

_by Karen Doore · TAI-KPI Framework · Avalanche of Kindness_

Before you encounter the framework, you should know something about where it comes from.

This work was built by someone who has spent decades at the intersection of art, engineering, science, and education — and who has spent the last decade learning to heal from complex trauma. That personal history is not incidental. It is the reason this framework treats the learner's nervous system as the first site of intervention, rather than the last.

Most AI literacy programs assume that humans, given the right information, will make better decisions. This framework begins from a different premise: **that humans under stress, in polarized environments, saturated by information and anxiety, cannot absorb new frameworks until something first helps them stabilize.** That is not a weakness to correct. It is a biological reality to design around.

## What this framework is

The **Bridge Checklist** is the applied expression of the TAI-KPI framework — years of interdisciplinary research across modeling and simulation, consciousness science, evolutionary biology, institutional design, and information theory. It is also, in the oldest sense, a teaching story.

Long before written language, humans navigated VUCA conditions — volatile harvests, uncertain winters, threatening strangers, unknown territories — using art, ritual, song, fable, and play. Stories like _Stone Soup_ exist across dozens of cultures not by coincidence but because they encode a survival technology: **how to build collective intelligence and community coherence across difference, without requiring anyone to abandon their beliefs first.**

This framework draws on that tradition. The card deck, the facilitated sessions, the humor, the oracle structure — these are not decorative. They are functional tools for co-regulation, epistemic widening, and values clarification, tested across millennia before they were tested in any laboratory.

## What this framework is not

{% hint style="info" %}
* It is not a technical manual for using AI tools correctly.
* It is not a warning against AI.
* It is not politically aligned with any position on AI development, regulation, or deployment.
* It does not require you to agree with any particular worldview before it becomes useful.

## The central claim

We are living through a paradigm shift — from static, control-oriented, egocentric organizational structures toward dynamic, oscillatory, ecocentric ones. This shift is not optional. It is being driven by the thermodynamic reality that dominance hierarchies are not resilient at planetary scale, and that kindness and collaboration are not sentimental ideals but **the evolutionarily and thermodynamically viable path for radical human adaptation.**

AI is the most visible surface of this shift. But the shift is about human information processing — about learning to hold uncertainty, widen sensing, and act with integrity — at a moment when the stakes of getting it wrong are genuinely high.

The goal of this framework is not to make humans better at using AI systems.

**The goal is to use AI literacy as a doorway for humans to develop flexible, ecocentric mental models that can navigate what is coming — together.**

## A word about AI as the outsider

{% hint style="info" %}
Every teaching story needs an outsider — the stranger who arrives in the village, the unknown ingredient in the soup. AI plays that role here. Not as villain. Not as savior. But as the entity that arrives from outside the embodied human community, carrying both extraordinary gifts and genuine dangers, and whose presence forces the community to decide what it actually values.

What do we value? How do we know what's true? Who bears the costs of our choices? What does it mean to act well when we cannot be certain?

These are not new questions. They are the oldest questions. AI just made them urgent again.

_This framework is a living document. It grows as the world changes and as the community of practitioners using it teaches back. If you use it, adapt it, or find yourself arguing with it — that is exactly what it is designed to produce._

_Welcome to the conversation._
