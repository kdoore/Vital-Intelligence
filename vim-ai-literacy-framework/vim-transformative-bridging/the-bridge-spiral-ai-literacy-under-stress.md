# The Bridge Spiral: AI Literacy Under Stress

_A trauma-informed workflow for navigating information and AI tools without fear._

**Why this exists**\
AI can amplify noise, certainty theater, and social harm. This workflow trains a calmer, more accurate way to interact with information — especially during climate, health, or civic emergencies.

**Three instruments**

* **Gyroscope:** _Am I in a state to think clearly?_
* **Radar:** _Am I seeing enough of the real system?_
* **Compass:** _Am I ready to act with integrity?_\
  **Integration (Clubs):** _Do I need to cope, adapt, or transform?_

***

#### Step 0 — Safety rule (self-kindness first)

If you feel flooded, ashamed, panicked, or numb: **slow down**.\
This is not weakness. It’s how the brain protects itself.

***

### A) Gyroscope (Hearts)

**P — Pause (10–60 seconds)**

* Breathe. Feel feet/hands. Name your state in one sentence.
* Ask: _Am I activated? Am I tired? Am I hungry? Am I triggered?_

**R — Regulation**

* Choose one stabilizer: water, movement, grounding, supportive contact, a short walk.
* If conflict is present, aim for **repair-ready** (not “win-ready”).

***

### B) Radar (Spades)

**U — Uncertainty tolerance**

* Replace “I know” with: _How confident am I (0–10)? What would change my mind?_

**S — Sources**

* Ask: _Where did this come from? Who benefits if I believe it?_
* Prefer primary sources, named experts, and transparent methods.

**E — Externalities**

* Ask: _Who pays the hidden cost? (labor, ecosystems, vulnerable groups, long-term trust)_

***

### C) Compass (Diamonds)

**O — Orientation**

* Reframe: _What system am I in? What incentives are shaping behavior?_

**V — Validation**

* Use a “small test” before big conclusions (triangulate, compare, log assumptions).

**K — Kindness**

* Choose an action that **minimizes harm** and supports dignity.
* Kindness = warm truth + firm limits + repair commitment.

***

### D) Integration (Clubs)

Ask one question: **Is this a coping, adapting, or transforming moment?**

* **Cope:** stabilize and reduce harm now
* **Adapt:** change habits/tools/processes
* **Transform:** change rules/incentives when the system is harmful

***

#### AI use rules (fear-free)

* **Use “mixture of experts”:** ask 2–3 systems + compare.
* **Use Wikipedia as a bias check:** compare claims to neutral summaries and citations.
* **Avoid social feeds when stressed:** they are optimized for activation, not truth.
* **Log your assumptions:** date, source, confidence, what would update your view.
